                                This reduces our lead time on 2D CAD and 3D CAD Projects by
                                ensuring itâ€™s assigned to an appropriate Designer swiftly
                                and prioritised internally.
                                <br /><br />
                                Our fee for this service is 15% amount of total quoted
                                price, with some projects turned around in 1-2 days as
                                opposed to 7 days.

                                For larger projects our standard lead time can be longer
                                than a week, however the Fast Track Service still applies
                                reducing turn around where possible. To assist further we
                                can allocate a pair of designers or a dedicated team
                                depending on the scale of the project.
