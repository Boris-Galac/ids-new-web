                                    With 2D Drawings existing for this project we were tasked
                                    in creating a 3D CAD Model within Solidworks, including
                                    all windows, doors, wall structure, internal fittings and
                                    lighting.

                                    The configurations of each unit were created then combined
                                    together, ensuring the layout matched the original 2D
                                    Drawing. Additionally fabrication staircases were also 3D
                                    Modelled in Solidworks for access. Branding files were
                                    used and applied to the side of each unit along with
                                    relevant materials and finishes, Keyshot was used to
                                    create numerous images.

                                    The design progressed from R & D to creating manufacturing
                                    drawings ready for Prototype Build, using Solidworks
                                    software to generate the Assembly and relevant parts.
                                    There was a mix of CFD and 3D Printing during the project
                                    to ascertain the final design.

                                    Drawings / 3D Rendering for crowdfunding then let us know,
                                    beyond this we are able to use the same Assembly to create
                                    Manufacturing Drawings, once the design has been
                                    progressed.

                                    Working with UK and International Teams involved in Circuit Design, Mechanical

                                    issues as they arose as well as developing new fixture techniques and ensuring
                                    packaging design was fully resolved. This helped to ensure all required components
                                    fit together with very high tolerances and ensured the product was durable enough
                                    for rugged on-site usage.

                                    High resolution (8k+) images were provided of each product to be used by marketing
                                    departments and for use in printed materials and marketing launches/website usage.
                                    Using Solidworks Composer, high detail assembly documents and quick start guides
                                    were also produced to ensure products were fully re-configurable by the end user.

                                    With the 2D CAD (.DWG) drawings already existing on this project, we used the data
                                    to convert directly to 3D. Using Solidworks software we then pieced the parts
                                    together to create an Assembly.

                                    Once the 3D Model Assembly was ready we created a catalog of Manufacturing Drawings
                                    for future use, including flat patterns (DXF) and formed views for the shop floor.

                                    Using the same 3D Model we also provided a range of Rendered Images for marketing

                                    initially draught up the idea then provided various images of the product stacked,
                                    individual and with / without luxury pens.

                                    This particular product was available in a range of material finishes; therefore we
                                    applied a library of different Rendered Images showcasing their design. To assist
                                    our client we also 3D Printed the product to test fitting and scale in comparison to
                                    the pen.

                                    The customer required individual Exploded Rendered Images providing a clear image
                                    from various camera angles, with parts also itemized for their clients. For some
                                    sheet metal parts we were provided with the DXF flat pattern, which made Reverse
                                    Engineering an easier task.

                                    A Design Brief was provided for a food-safe Double Conveyor system. Using a 2D
                                    AutoCAD plan, we set entrance/exit points and heights, then developed parts,
                                    sub-assemblies, and the main assembly. <br><br>

                                    Once approved, we organized sheet metal, machined, extrusion, and bought-out parts
                                    into supplier drawings and a categorized Bill of Materials.<br><br>

                                    SolidWorks was used for design, interference checks, and file exports tailored to
                                    supplier needs.<br><br>

                                    Following approval manufacturing cutting lists were prepared with individual part

                                    This project combined 3D CAD design and rendered images to showcase the clientâ€™s
                                    concept from multiple angles. Using SolidWorks, we developed several prototype
                                    versions, focusing on complex surfacing and ergonomics. <br><br>

                                    We produced concept drawings, a Bill of Materials linked to parts, and detailed
                                    assembly drawings with exploded views. A 360Â° rendered image was also created for
                                    interactive display on the clientâ€™s website. <br><br>

                                    In total, 31 rendered images were provided, highlighting key features from various
                                    angles, including transparent materials. <br><br>

                                    If you need rendered images, CAD animations, or concept drawings for your product

                                    With the Eco-Friendly Shutter Design already part-progressed we were assigned to
                                    take the existing data and extrusions to Convert into 3D. Using Solidworks CAD
                                    software we progressed the 3D Model and liaised directly with our client on a weekly
                                    basis for their knowledge and input. The priority was to provide a clear

                                    To assist the customer we produced a 3D Printed Prototype of the product to aid
                                    their demonstrations to potential clients and buyers, scaled down to fit inside a
                                    carry-case, with foam moldings to suit the parts.

                                    progressing a wide range of drawing types. This often involves multiple revisions
                                    throughout the project lifecycle, as well as meetings to review and incorporate
                                    required changes.
